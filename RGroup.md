This spring I will organize a Machine Learning Reading Group at the University of Edinburgh. Please stay tuned for the abstract and titles of the talks. A preliminary schedule will follow soon.

In 2018-2019 I organized a Machine Learning Seminar. An overview of the talks is provided below. Please feel free to contact me if you want to get in touch with any of the speakers. 

23 October - Tim Hurst "Utilising continuum limits of the p-Laplacian in semi-supervised learning"

30 October - Professor Benedict Leimkuhler "Scary Computers"

6 November - Professor Kostas Zygalakis "Explicit stabilised methods and their use in optimization and sampling"

20 November - Dr Frederik Heber "Sampling in Neural Network Loss Manifolds"

27 November - Dr Sergio Jiménez Sanjuán, Senior Data Scientist at DNV-GL Energy /  Applied Physics Department, University of Zaragoza, will talk about "Data Science for the Wind Power Industry" 

<!---Abstract

We will review different innovation lines developed in DNV-GL  applied to the wind power industry where data science is involved by means of machine learning, resampling methods, forecasting, spatial statistics or strategy optimization. This research is applied to different parts of a wind power project value chain like site prospections, future energy and revenue assessments, asset operations and management or electricity markets. -->

4 December - Anton Martinsson "Quantifying Gerrymandering"
<!---Abstract

I will talk about how Markov Chain Monte Carlo has been used to reveal the geo-political structure in North Carolina (NC) which resulted in a mathematician going to court. I will outline the approach of the NC group and how they propose to solve the problem, but as this is a very difficult open problem, questions and suggestions are welcomed from the audience. This is NOT my own work but the work of the Mattingly gerrymandering group at Duke University, https://sites.duke.edu/quantifyinggerrymandering/about/

18 December - Dr Charlie Matthews "Computing tail probabilities in Bayesian inference for astrophysics"

15 January - Dr Zofia Trstanova "Coarse-graining with machine learning in molecular dynamics"

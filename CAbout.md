Hi there! Iâ€™m Tiffany.

![Me]({{TiffanyVlaar.github.io}}/pics/me.jpeg)

I'm a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh and will be using this blog to post about my own research and other research topics that sparked my interest. I'm always looking for new collaborators, so if you are interested in my work, please feel free to drop me an email. 

<!---As a hobby I really enjoy traveling and hiking, so I simply couldn't resist adding some blogposts with pictures and recommended travel routes for some of my favourite travel destinations. Hope you enjoy!-->

Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is gradually becoming integrated
into everyday life. A relatively underexplored research area is how its usage may
pose new challenges to students' learning process for solving coding problems.
We ran coding interventions across three Schools –  Physics and Astronomy, Mathematics and Statistics, Geographical and Earth Sciences​ – to improve coding education across different disciplines by exploring
<ol>
<li> How do students perceive and understand AI and coding?  </li>
<li> Can our intervention change these perceptions?​ </li>
<li> What are the differences between students’ perceptions in different subjects?​  </li>
</ol>

The materials (including those PhD student Lewis Dean and myself designed for level 2 Mathematics and Statistics students) we designed for the coding workshops can be found here: [GitHub Page](https://github.com/CCC-AI-era/workshop_general_public)

We are currently wrapping up our first year, which was made possible by Crucible grant funding, and are working on publication(s) related to this research.

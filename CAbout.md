Hi there! I'm Tiffany, a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, where I develop new neural network optimization techniques based on discretized stochastic differential equations, inspired by molecular dynamics. <!--- and will be using this blog to post about my own research and other research topics that sparked my interest.--> I'm always looking for new collaborators (and in fact currently searching for a postdoc position for September 2022!), so if you are interested in [my research]({{TiffanyVlaar.github.io}}/jekyll/REsearch)), please feel free to drop me an email. 

<!---As a hobby I really enjoy traveling and hiking, so I simply couldn't resist adding some blogposts with pictures and recommended travel routes for some of my favourite travel destinations. Hope you enjoy!-->

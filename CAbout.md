Hi there! I'm Tiffany, a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, where I develop physics-inspired optimization schemes for neural network training, often based on discretized stochastic differential equations. I'm always looking for new collaborators, so if you are interested in [my research]({{TiffanyVlaar.github.io}}/research), please feel free to drop me an email.

Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is gradually becoming integrated
into everyday life. A relatively underexplored research area is how its usage may
pose new challenges to students' learning process for solving coding problems.
We ran coding interventions across three Schools –  Physics and Astronomy, Mathematics and Statistics, Geographical and Earth Sciences​ – to:
explore current students’ understanding of AI and coding; and
to improve coding education across different disciplines.

The materials (including those PhD student Lewis Dean and myself designed for level 2 mathematics and statistics students) we designed for the coding workshops can be found here: https://github.com/CCC-AI-era/workshop_general_public

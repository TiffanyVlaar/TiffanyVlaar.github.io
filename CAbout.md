Hi there, I'm Tiffany! I recently completed my PhD in Mathematics of Deep Learning at the University of Edinburgh.
<!--, where I developed physics-inspired optimization schemes for neural network training, often based on discretized stochastic differential equations.-->
I will start a Postdoc at Mila and the School of Computer Science at McGill University in August 2022. 

I'm always looking for new collaborators, so if you are interested in [my research]({{TiffanyVlaar.github.io}}/research), please feel free to drop me an email.

Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is gradually becoming integrated
into everyday life. A relatively underexplored research area is how its usage may
pose new challenges to students' learning process for solving coding problems. We
ran coding interventions for level 2 students across different disciplines to explore current studentsâ€™ understanding of AI and
serve as a basis for developing new pedagogies with relevance for both higher education and beyond.

The materials we designed for the coding workshops can be found here: https://github.com/CCC-AI-era/workshop_general_public

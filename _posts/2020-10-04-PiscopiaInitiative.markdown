***Despite the fact that 40% of UK graduates in the mathematical sciences are female, only
6% of them go on to be professors [LMS report, 2013].*** I co-founded the Piscopia Initiative [(piscopia.co.uk)](https://piscopia.co.uk) to tackle this. We aim to encourage women and non-binary students to pursue a PhD in Mathematics. 

***How do we do this?*** <br>
We offer both UK-wide and university-specific events at [11 UK universities through our local Piscopia committees](https://piscopia.co.uk/the-piscopia-society/). These are all aimed at women and non-binary undergraduate/
MSc students in mathematics and related disciplines, and have a number of aims.  <br>
Firstly, they ***raise awareness*** for the PhD option among our target group and increase the
attendees’ knowledge about doing a PhD and the application process. Further to this,
they ***highlight women and non-binary role models***. Finally, the events provide attendees
with a ***support network and platform*** where they can ask questions in the future by
connecting them with their peers, women & non-binary researchers at their university, and
the UK-wide Piscopia community.

Our events consist of: <br>
• [PiWORKS monthly seminar series](https://piscopia.co.uk/piworks-seminar-series/) featuring women and non-binary mathematics researchers from UK universities working in diverse research areas. <br>
• [PiDOORS](https://piscopia.co.uk/pidoors) an afternoon of talks by women who have a PhD in mathematics and who are currently working in industry. <br>
• [Annual PiFORUM conference](https://piscopia.co.uk/welcome-to-piforum/), consisting of talks by women and non-binary researchers, talks on PhD life, guidance on PhD applications, mock interviews for the attendees,
and plenty of time for questions and networking. <br>
• Piscopia Society events at 11 different UK universities, held by local
committees consisting of both PhD students and active student members, who
host PhD information and networking events for women and non-binary students
at their university. These events raise awareness for the PhD option, equip the
students with the information they may be hesitant to seek, and provide them with
female and non-binary role models at their own university. You can find a full list of
committees [here](https://piscopia.co.uk/the-piscopia-society/) <br>
• Gradcafe forum, which will provide an anonymous platform for students to ask
quesIons to the wider Piscopia community. <br>
• Piscopia Society and corresponding [mailing list](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc-FZJdwpj408GP1rohoC9z6-fNNv--WCP52_vC6gWIte5-bw/viewform?usp=send_form), aimed at building a UK-wide
community of women & non-binary students and mathematics researchers.

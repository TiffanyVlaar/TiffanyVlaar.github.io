There was a time when Peru dominated the world market with their export of guano - seabird excrement - which turned out to be one of the best natural fertilizers in the world. A combination of the hot, dry climate and the massive amount of seabirds on rocky islands off Peru's coast led to the golden guano era for Peru in the 1840-1870s. Despite making for a nice anecdote, the guano industry in South America is fascinating from a political and historical viewpoint. 

Back in the 1800s Europe and the US were desperate to find new fertilizers for their depleted soils, and Peru, by having access to the best guano in the world, could control the world market. Guano was declared state property of Peru in 1840, and the massive export of the substance seemed to provide wealth and prosperity to the peruvians for many years. Although the wealth was of course mostly concentrated in the hands of a select few, the guano era still managed to revitalize the economy and cause a literary boom as well - and Lima was floroushing.

However, apart from their slave trade to secure guano laborers, Peru itself would soon also experience the drawbacks of their actions. The Peruvian government had been taking guano-backed loans from domestic and foreign lenders, making Peru more and more reliant on their guano export for state funding over the years. At the same time the guano resources were becoming depleted. Desperate for a new resource Peru went to war with Chile for another source of fertilizer - sodium nitrate found in the driest deser in the world, the Atacama Desert. This war, which Chile won, caused Peru to deplete their last financial resources. Despite Chile's victory, also their nitrate industry came to an end due to the creation of a synthetic substitute for nitrates. And just like that all the fictitious wealth accumulated in Peru and Chile dissipated into thin air, leaving many befumbled. Nowadays - the seabird populations in Peru have dwindled severely, but the growth of the organic food sector has revived the guano industry somewhat. This way guano still continues to play an important role in Peru.

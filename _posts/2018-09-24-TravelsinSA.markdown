Main highlight of the trip was Kruger National Park:

I'll add details on the route we took through the park later on.
We also visited the Drakensbergen national park and nearby Royal Natal National Park. Highlight here was the Amphitheatre, a massively impressive 500m high, 5km long rock wall, which is the home of the worlds second tallest waterfall, Tugela Falls.

On the western cape some hidden pearls along the Garden Route are: Hermanus, Knysna and Towerkop National Park.

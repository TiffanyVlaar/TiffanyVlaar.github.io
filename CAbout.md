Hi there, I'm an upcoming Lecturer (Assistant Professor) working in the areas of mathematics of deep learning and physics-inspired machine learning for applications in climate change.

I'm always looking for new collaborators, so if you are interested in [my research]({{TiffanyVlaar.github.io}}/research), please feel free to drop me an email.

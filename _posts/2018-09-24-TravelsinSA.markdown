Main highlight of the trip was Kruger National Park:

I'll add details on the route we took through the park later on.
We also visited the Drakensbergen national park, which is absolutely gorgeous. On the western cape some hidden pearls along the Garden Route are: Hermanus, Knysna and Towerkop National Park.

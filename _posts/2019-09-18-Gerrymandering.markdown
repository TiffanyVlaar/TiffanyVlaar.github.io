Gerrymandering is a term originating from US politics and involves the redrawing of constituency boundaries for the gain of a specific political party. Rule one of gerrymandering is to maximise the amount of "wasted votes" of your opposing political party, while minimising the amount for your own party. We consider votes for your party to be wasted in constituencies where your party lost, because these votes could instead have been used to allow your party to win in neighbouring swing constituencies. Similarly, in a constituency where your party won, a significant surplus in votes for your party are also wasted, i.e., it doesn't matter if you won with 80% of the votes or 55% of the votes. There surplus votes could also be moved to change the outcome in other constituencies to your party's benefit.

FUNDING: University of Glasgow, Crucible Seed Funding Award, Â£7,398
 
This interdisciplinary project brings together researchers from marine science, machine learning (ML), sonic and immersive arts to develop an interdisciplinary workflow allowing diverse audiences to experience a range of complex marine datasets simultaneously. This will help us understand when and why biodiversity is changing over time, in a novel immersive and intuitively derived way with the aim to inform decision-making processes surrounding data analysis and promote engagement with our oceans.
 
The workflow will be evidenced using a long-term image and soundscape deep-sea coral reef dataset, integrating marine-, machine learning- and arts-based knowledge and approaches. This holistic sensory approach to data science is expected to increase a sense of connection to and agency over the protection of our oceans. Further, it is expected to increase the rate at which scientific insights are made and guide data analytical priorities. The project aims to engage those interested in understanding and monitoring our oceans, such as researchers, coastal communities, and the wider public

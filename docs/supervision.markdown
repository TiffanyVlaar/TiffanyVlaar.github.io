If you are interested in my research, please feel free to reach out to me to discuss PhD (or MSc Research) options at the University of Glasgow. In your email please include your CV, university transcripts, and any dissertations/papers you may have written (but do not worry if you do not have any publications at this stage).

Funding is available, but requires going through the School's application process. More information can be found here: https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/research/postgraduate/
Shortlisting starts early January, with scholarship decisions being made later mid-January. The process continues until all funded places are awarded.

The University of Glasgow also offers James McCune Smith scholarships for black UK domiciled students. More information: https://www.gla.ac.uk/scholarships/mccune-smith/

Further, I am a PhD supervisor within the DiveIn CDT. This CDT prioritises diversity and aims to produce transformative interdisciplinary research in various areas, including Net Zero and AI. It offers fully funded four-year interdisciplinary PhDs starting in September 2025.
Applications are due: 31 January 2025. More information: https://www.divein.org.uk
Please reach out to me if you are interested in applying for this opportunity.

Deep learning can aid timely analysis of camera trap data.  However, image classifications collected through citizen science projects typically feature disagreement amongst volunteers, i.e. label ground truth uncertainty, which may affect the accuracy of deep learning models trained on such labels. 
In joint work with student Leonard Hockerts and ecologist Dr Peter Stewart we consider combined camera trap and citizen science datasets featuring East African animals. We investigate (species-specific) test accuracy under different model choices and levels of training ground truth uncertainty on images with different levels of classification difficulty.

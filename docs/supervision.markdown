If you are interested in my [research]({{TiffanyVlaar.github.io}}/research), please feel free to **reach out to me** to discuss PhD options at the University of Glasgow. In your email please include your CV, university transcripts, and any dissertations/papers you may have written (but do not worry if you do not have any publications at this stage).

- Funding is available, but requires going through the School's application process. More information can be found [here]( https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/research/postgraduate/) <br>
Shortlisting starts **early January**, with scholarship decisions being made later mid-January. The process continues until all funded places are awarded.

- The University of Glasgow also offers **James McCune Smith scholarships** for black UK domiciled students. More information: [https://www.gla.ac.uk/scholarships/mccune-smith/](https://www.gla.ac.uk/scholarships/mccune-smith/)

- Further, I am a PhD supervisor within the **DiveIn CDT**. This CDT prioritises diversity and aims to produce transformative interdisciplinary research in various areas, including Net Zero and AI. <br> It offers fully funded four-year interdisciplinary PhDs starting in September 2025. <br> Applications due: 31 January 2025. <br>

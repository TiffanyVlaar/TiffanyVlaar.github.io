[Constraint-based Regularization of Neural Networks]({{TiffanyVlaar.github.io}}/jekyll/update/2020/07/10/ConstraintBasedReg). *Accepted as spotlight presentation for NeurIPS 2020 Optimization for ML workshop.* <br>
In this paper we use constrained stochastic differential equations to train deep neural networks. We provide a general framework with accompanying discretization schemes and a statistical guarantee on the convergence of the
training. This general framework enables the implementation of powerful new constraints, such as orthogonality of the weight matrix. 

[Partitioned Integrators for Thermodynamic Parameterization of Neural Networks]({{TiffanyVlaar.github.io}}/jekyll/update/2019/08/31/NewPaper.html)*, Foundations of Data Science 1 (4) , 457-489 (2019). Accepted as digital acceptance to NeurIPS 2019 Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences workshop.* <br>
This thermodynamic parameterization technique for neural network training allows for enhanced exploration of problems with complicated loss landscapes, which are thought to arise in molecular dynamics applications.

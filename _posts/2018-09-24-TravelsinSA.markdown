Main highlight of the trip was Kruger National Park:

I'll add details on the route we took through the park later on.
We also visited the Drakensbergen national park and nearby Royal Natal National Park. Highlight here was the amphitheatre, a massively impressive 500m high, 5km long rock wall.

On the western cape some hidden pearls along the Garden Route are: Hermanus, Knysna and Towerkop National Park.

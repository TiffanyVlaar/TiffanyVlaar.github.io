<!--If you are interested in my [research]({{TiffanyVlaar.github.io}}/research), please feel free to **reach out to me** to discuss **funded PhD options** at the University of Glasgow. In your email please include your CV, university transcripts, and any dissertations/papers you may have written (but do not worry if you do not have any publications at this stage).

- Funding is available, but requires going through the School's application process. More information on the application process can be found [here]( https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/research/postgraduate/) and more info on the project **Dissecting Neural Networks** can be found on the [FindAPhD page](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/phd-in-mathematics-dissecting-neural-networks/?p180056) <br>
Shortlisting starts **early January**, with scholarship decisions being made later in January. The process continues until all funded places are awarded.

- The University of Glasgow also offers **James McCune Smith scholarships** for black UK domiciled students. More information: [https://www.gla.ac.uk/scholarships/mccune-smith/](https://www.gla.ac.uk/scholarships/mccune-smith/)
-->

**Opportunities**
- I will be supervising a project on **Deep Learning Optimization and Design Choices for Marine Biodiversity Monitoring** with Dr. De Clippele (University of Glasgow) within the **Leverhulme Programme for Doctoral Training in Ecological Data Science**. Applications due: 7 March 2025. All info on: [https://ecological-data-science.github.io](https://ecological-data-science.github.io) <br>
Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you are interested in applying for this opportunity.

- Further, I am a PhD supervisor within the **DiveIn CDT**. This CDT prioritises diversity and aims to produce transformative interdisciplinary research in various areas, including Net Zero and AI. <!-- <br> It offers fully funded four-year interdisciplinary PhDs starting in September 2025. <br> -->
More information: [DiveIn CDT](https://www.divein.org.uk) and [my supervisor profile](https://www.divein.org.uk/supervisor/tiffanyvlaar/) <br>
If you have been accepted onto the CDT, please do not hesitate to reach out to me if you are interested in my work. 

**Upcoming Supervision**
- The marine rewilding effect: Building a cost-effective framework for measuring Marine Net Gain project with Dr. De Clippele (main, University of Glasgow), Dr. Hogdson (CreditNature), and Dr. Wartmann (University of Aberdeen) within the [NETGAIN CDT](https://netgain.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk).
- Developing GPU-accelerated digital twins of ecological systems for population monitoring and scenario analyses project with Prof. Torney (main, University of Glasgow), Prof. Morales (University of Glasgow), Prof. McCrea (Lancaster University), and Prof. Husmeier (University of Glasgow) within the [ExaGEO CDT](https://www.exageo.org).
- UG Summer Research project on Monitoring vegetation patterns from drone imagery using machine learning, with Dr. Eizenh√∂fer (University of Glasgow).
